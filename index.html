    <p class="wado">A flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information on both sides,
        which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an
        answer on the othe</p>

            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies
                of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client
                side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. </p>

        <div class="operate">
            <p>In computer programming, operators are constructs defined within programming languages which
                behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically. Common simple
                examples include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.</p>

        <div class="show-var">
            <p> A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the
                program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and
                data that the program uses when it is running.</p>

        <div class="var-convent">
            <p>For variables, the Java naming convention is to always start with a lowercase letter and then
                capitalize the first letter of every subsequent word. Variables in Java are not allowed to
                contain white space, so variables made from compound words are to be written with a lower camel
                case syntax.</p>

            <p>A function is a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task. They provide
                better modularity for your application and reuse-ability. Depending on the programming language,
                a function may be called a subroutine, a procedure, a routine, a method, or a subprogram.</p>

            <p>A method in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated with a message and an
                object.
                An object consists of data and behavior; these compose an interface, which specifies how the
                object may be utilized by any of its various consumers. A method is a behavior of an object
                parametrized by a consumer. </p>

            <p>In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are
                independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to
                customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter." See argc.</p>

                pieces of data are the values of the arguments with which the subroutine is going to be
